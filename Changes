0.013 Sun Mar 27 22:14:41 EDT 2011
  - include debug.sh in MANIFEST so it is distributed
  - missed a replacement of "perl" to Probe::Perl->find_perl_interpreter() last time.  all should be covered now.
  - make all scripts executable (755) so interpreter doesn't need to be called on CLI.
  - add test for existence of generated debug.sh

  replaced use of '$^X' with Probe::Perl to find interpreter to use in system call in t/001_load.t  it was suggested to use $^X in place of 'perl' for the purpose.  while that solution worked on my ubuntu boxes, it started failing in cpantesters (can't find Module::Install ...).  Probe::Perl was also suggested. Local testing is fine, so moving to cpantesters
